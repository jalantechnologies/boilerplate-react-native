# Boilerplate React Native

## Requirements

Node 16 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 10 or up.

You also need to install the dependencies required by React Native:

 - for [Android development](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies-3)
 - for [iOS development](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies)

## Running the project

Assuming you have all requirements installed, you can run the project by running:

 - `yarn start` to start the metro bundler, in a dedicated terminal window
 - `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to run the application on any of these platform
